# Blog_API
  This project was developed as part of a practical exercise during an App Brewery bootcamp, aiming to demonstrate skills in 
developing RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express.js.

  This is an API developed for a blog, allowing the creation, updating and deletion of posts. The project uses HTTP methods 
for data manipulation and was implemented using Node.js with Express.js for the backend and EJS for rendering the views.
  

Server Simulation and API Response

  In this project, in addition to implementing the API, the server that makes requests to the API was also simulated, as well 
as the API response to the server. This allowed us to test and validate the functioning of the API independently.


Functionalities

   - Post Creation: Allows users to create new posts for the blog.
   - Post Update: Allows you to update existing posts.
   - Post Deletion: Allows users to delete blog posts.

Technologies Used

   - Node.js: Used as the server execution environment.
   - Express.js: Web framework used to create the API.
   - EJS: Visualization engine used to render views.

How to use

   1) Clone this repository.
   2) Install dependencies using npm install.
   3) Create two instances of the terminal, and start the servers using 'npm start main' for the API backend,
      and 'npm start server.js' for the client-server.
